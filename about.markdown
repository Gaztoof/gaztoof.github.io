Welcome to my reverse engineering blog! 

I'm **Gaztoof**, a Belgian reverse engineer with over 8 years of experience in .NET internals and 6+ years in native application and firmware analysis. My work primarily involves reverse engineering firmware to uncover proprietary algorithms, bypass protections, and fully understand how software functions—whether it’s identifying potential malicious behavior or reconstructing software from the ground up.

Throughout my career, I’ve reverse-engineered Windows applications, kernel drivers, Android binaries, embedded firmware, and more. In addition to my skills with C#, C++, and assembly, I possess a deep and broad understanding of **PC architecture, software systems, and embedded firmware**.

I have a logical mindset and a natural ability to quickly learn new concepts, which allows me to adapt to new machines, software, and challenges with ease. Whether it’s working with unfamiliar systems or diving into complex problems, I’m confident in my ability to methodically break things down and find solutions.

On this blog, I share my research, findings, and solutions. Whether you're new to reverse engineering or a seasoned pro, I hope my work provides valuable insights and sparks your interest.
